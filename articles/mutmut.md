# Comprehensive Cheat Sheet for Using MuMut in Mutation Testing

Mutation testing is a robust methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of test suites by introducing small code changes (mutations) and ensuring the tests detect them. MuMut is a powerful tool designed for automating this process.

This cheat sheet will guide you through using MuMut effectively, with a focus on commands, configurations, and real-world use cases.

---

## What is MuMut?

MuMut (Mutation Mutation Testing Tool) is an open-source framework designed to:
- Identify weaknesses in your test suite.
- Measure code coverage quality through introduced mutations.
- Provide insightful reports on undetected mutations.

---

## Installation

Install MuMut via package managers or directly from its repository:

```bash
# Install via pip (Python environment)
pip install mumut

# Or clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/example/mumut.git
cd mumut
python setup.py install
```

---

## Basic Commands

### 1. Initialize MuMut in a Project

```bash
mumut init
```
This sets up the required configuration files in your project directory.

### 2. Run Mutation Testing

```bash
mumut run
```
Executes mutations and tests against your suite.

### 3. Generate a Report

```bash
mumut report
```
Creates a detailed HTML or JSON report showing:
- Survived mutations
- Killed mutations
- Coverage statistics

### 4. Cleanup

```bash
mumut clean
```
Removes temporary files and resets the environment.

---

## Configuration File (`mumut.yml`)

The configuration file allows you to customize how MuMut operates. Below is a typical example:

```yaml
mutations:
  - arithmetic: true
  - conditional: true
  - constants: true
output:
  format: html
  directory: reports
tests:
  framework: pytest
  include: "tests/"
thresholds:
  mutation_coverage: 85
```

### Key Parameters
- **`mutations`**: Types of mutations to apply (arithmetic, logical, constants, etc.).
- **`output`**: Format and location for generated reports.
- **`tests.framework`**: Specify the test framework (e.g., `pytest`, `unittest`).
- **`thresholds.mutation_coverage`**: Minimum acceptable mutation coverage percentage.

---

## Use Cases for Mutation Testing with MuMut

### 1. **Evaluating Test Suite Strength**
By introducing controlled errors, MuMut helps evaluate how effectively the test suite identifies issues. This improves confidence in production readiness.

#### Example
If a mutation in a conditional branch (`if (x > y)`) is not detected, your test suite may lack coverage for edge cases in comparison logic.

### 2. **Improving Code Quality**
MuMut identifies specific areas of the code that lack test coverage. Developers can use this insight to write targeted tests.

#### Example Workflow
1. Run `mumut run`.
2. Analyze the report for survived mutations.
3. Add missing tests and re-run MuMut.

### 3. **Regression Testing Analysis**
Ensure new code changes do not introduce regression by validating existing test suites with MuMut.

#### Scenario
Before merging a feature branch, integrate MuMut into CI/CD pipelines to verify adequate test coverage and resilience to changes.

### 4. **Ensuring Critical Path Coverage**
For critical application workflows, MuMut highlights untested failure points, ensuring critical paths are rigorously tested.

#### Example
E-commerce applications can use MuMut to confirm the checkout workflow is robust against edge cases like incorrect pricing or user authentication errors.

## Integration with CI/CD

Automate mutation testing in your CI/CD pipeline for continuous feedback:

### Example with GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Mutation Testing

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  mutation-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt mumut

    - name: Run MuMut
      run: mumut run

    - name: Upload Reports
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: mutation-reports
        path: reports/
```

---

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Use Targeted Mutations:** Focus on critical modules to avoid excessive runtime.
2. **Iterate Incrementally:** Run MuMut after every significant code change to keep mutation coverage consistent.
3. **Combine with Code Coverage Tools:** Use MuMut alongside code coverage tools for a holistic view of test suite effectiveness.
