# How to Write an Incident Report for Cybersecurity: Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability in Web Application

## Introduction

An incident report serves as a critical document for detailing cybersecurity issues, assessing risks, and initiating mitigation steps. This guide outlines how to write an effective incident report for a specific issue: unrestricted file upload vulnerabilities in web applications. These vulnerabilities occur when an application allows users to upload files without sufficient validation, exposing the system to malicious files, arbitrary code execution, and other security risks.

## Key Components of an Incident Report

### 1. **Title and Summary**
- **Example Title**: "Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability in Web Application"
- **Summary**: Provide a concise overview of the issue and its potential impact. For instance:
  > "The web application permits unrestricted file uploads, allowing attackers to upload malicious files that compromise server integrity and data security."

### 2. **Incident Description**
Describe the vulnerability and how it was identified. Use clear, technical language.

**Example Description**:
> The web application allows users to upload files to the server without implementing proper validation or security controls. This unrestricted file upload vulnerability occurs when the application fails to enforce restrictions on file types, sizes, or content. Attackers can exploit this flaw by uploading malicious files, such as executable scripts, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, server compromise, or data manipulation.

### 3. **Risk Assessment**
Outline the potential impact of the vulnerability on the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Risk Example**:
> This vulnerability poses a critical risk. Malicious uploads can lead to remote code execution, data breaches, and service disruptions. In environments processing uploaded files automatically, attackers may gain elevated privileges, resulting in significant operational and reputational damage.

### 4. **Technical Details**
Include specific details about the vulnerability:
- **Affected Systems**: Identify the components or endpoints vulnerable to file uploads.
- **Exploitability**: Explain how attackers can exploit the flaw.
- **Impact**: Specify the potential consequences, such as server compromise or data leaks.

### 5. **Steps to Reproduce**
Provide a step-by-step account of how the vulnerability was discovered.

**Example Steps**:
1. Navigate to the file upload endpoint of the application.
2. Upload a non-standard file type (e.g., `.exe` or `.php`).
3. Confirm that the server accepts the file without validation.
4. Attempt to execute the uploaded file on the server.

### 6. **Mitigation Measures**
List the recommended actions to address the vulnerability.

**Mitigation Example**:
- Implement strict file validation against an allowlist.
- Store uploaded files in non-executable directories.
- Perform malware scanning on all uploaded files.
- Use cryptographic hashing for unique file naming.
- Limit file size and number of uploads.

### 7. **Log Data**
Attach relevant log files or evidence to substantiate the incident. Highlight timestamps and activities indicating exploitation attempts.

### 8. **Timeline of Events**
Provide a chronological account of when the issue was identified, reported, and addressed.

**Example Timeline**:
- **2024-11-01**: Vulnerability identified during penetration testing.
- **2024-11-03**: Proof-of-concept exploit performed.
- **2024-11-05**: Incident reported to the development team.
- **2024-11-10**: Patch deployed to production.

### 9. **Recommendations**
Conclude with actionable insights to prevent similar incidents.

**Example Recommendations**:
- Conduct regular penetration testing.
- Train developers on secure coding practices.
- Monitor file upload activities for anomalies.

## Example Incident Report Template

```markdown
# Incident Report: Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability in Web Application

**Date:** 2024-11-30  
**Reported By:** [Name]  
**System/Component Affected:** [System Name or Component]  

## Summary
The web application allows unrestricted file uploads, exposing the system to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, and operational disruptions.

## Description
The application lacks validation controls on file uploads, permitting malicious files to compromise the server. This issue was identified during a routine security assessment.

## Risk Assessment
**Risk Level:** Critical  
**Potential Impact:**  
- Remote code execution on the server.  
- Data breaches due to unauthorized file access.  
- Service interruptions from storage overflow attacks.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Access the file upload feature.
2. Upload a `.php` file with embedded malicious code.
3. Execute the file via direct server access.

## Mitigation Measures
- Validate file types using an allowlist.  
- Store uploaded files in a secure, non-executable location.  
- Apply malware scanning to all uploaded files.  
- Restrict file upload access based on user roles.  

## Timeline of Events
- **2024-11-01**: Vulnerability identified.  
- **2024-11-03**: Proof-of-concept exploit conducted.  
- **2024-11-05**: Vulnerability reported to the security team.  
- **2024-11-10**: Patch deployed.
